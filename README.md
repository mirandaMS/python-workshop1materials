# python-workshop1materials
Materials for the Python Workshop 1 (Python Basics and Data Exploration), created for Data Services at the Rutgers-New Brunswick Libraries.

Please download the files in this repository to a directory you can access through Jupyter Notebook. We will be using the "Wkshp1_Part1_PythonBasicsDataExploration.ipynb", "Wkshp1_Part2_PythonBasicsDataExploration.ipynb", and "outbreaks.csv" files in-workshop; the other .ipynb files and the .py file are provided for your reference, as they contain solutions to exercises described in the workshop files. To open the .ipynb files, use Jupyter Notebook which comes with the Anaconda distribution of Python (recommended), or if you already have Python installed, you can follow these instructions to install Jupyter: http://jupyter.org/install.html.

The CSV file is a dataset from Kaggle which can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/foodborne-diseases) and which was released to the public domain under Creative Commons CC0.
